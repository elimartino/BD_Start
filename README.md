# BD_Start
This is a personal project for a belly dance info/registration web app. 
Features planned are as follows:
  1. General info page containing instructor info and overview statement
  2. Registration page to be used by individuals wanting to attend classes
  3. Contact form (Two possibilities)
    a.Text input for a subject, second text box for the message to be sent, and a third text input for submitters email for a response
    b.Simple "contact us" page containing the instructors email and any other contact info that is volunteered.
      i. This will only be implemented if the message form and email generation proves to be time consuming and could cause a missed deadline.
